Pasco coffee homepage only.
Simple practice with mobile-first development for the first time adapted from netninja tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hH1tAjyUPZPjbj-7s200a4), enjoyed and appreciated the benefits of starting simpler with the key elements and adding complexity as the screen grows, versus trying to whittle down a fuller design as it shrinks.
